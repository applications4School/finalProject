# Welcome to Notees ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

   


In order to run it on your phone, you must have the expo app. Once you run the app file in vscode you will scan the qr code and the application will load inside your expo app. 

In order to access the content inside the page you must have access to a proper email and password. 

This application is a notes app. It displays a home page, with 2 tabs of about and my notes. This happens after the user logs in or signs up. 

The app is called notees and it is a crud application. I was unable to get my firestore working so the data is being stored in the local storage instead. 

I enjoyed developing this project and I will definently be able to work on it and further develop it as time passes!
